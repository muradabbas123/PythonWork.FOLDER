  # (or) Operation

    # if atleat one statement is true it will print true

      # but if both statement is false then it will print false

        # most preference of OR operator is true



        # EXAMPLE


print                    (3 > 4 or 4 > 1)

print                           ( 2 > 3 or 3 < 1 )





 # (And) Operator

     # if both statement is true then it will print true

       # if one is false then it will print false

       # EXAMPLE

print         ( 100 > 2 and 900 > 2 )


print ( 20 > 100 and 1 > 0 )


   # (not) operator

    # it reverses the statement


        #EXAMPLE



print ( 3 > 2 ) # this statement is true but
                # if i apply not operator it will print false
print       (not 3 > 1)
